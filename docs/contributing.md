## 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Semantic Versioning & Conventional Commits 📚🔮

We use semantic versioning with conventional commits which are used to automatically generate the version, changelog and release notes and to make it easier to debug with a neat commit history.

### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Semantic Versioning 🎨🌈

The version will be automatically generated from commits.

### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Conventional Commits 🎨🎶

We use conventional commits in order to automatically generate the version, changelog and release notes and to make it easier to debug with a neat commit history.

#### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Commit ✔️👻

🪄✨ When making a commit do so using `type(scope): description` as the format in order to specifcy the type of commit, the scope, whether or not it's a breaking change and the description.\
🪄✨ Use the directory that is the primary focus of your changes as the scope.\
🪄✨ If the commit includes a breaking change then include `!` using `type(scope)!: description` as the format to specify that it changes existing code in a backwards incompatible way.\
🪄✨ Only use lowercase.

#### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Example ✔️👻

`git commit -S -am "feature(module)!: a new module feature"`

🪄✨ The commit is a new feature.\
🪄✨ The changes are primarily scoped to the `module` directory.\
🪄✨ It contains a breaking change.\
🪄✨ It's lowercase.

#### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Types 🔥🐛

🪄✨ feature - A new feature.\
🪄✨ update - Changes to an existing feature.\
🪄✨ patch - A small change to a module or component.\
🪄✨ security - Changes specifically related to security.\
🪄✨ performance - Changes specifically related to performance.\
🪄✨ config - Changes to configurations.\
🪄✨ build - Changes to the build.\
🪄✨ ci - Changes to the continuous integration.\
🪄✨ cd - Changes to the continuous deployment.\
🪄✨ fix - A bugfix.\
🪄✨ deprecate - Changes to deprecate functionality.\
🪄✨ remove - Changes that removed functionality.\
🪄✨ revert - A rollback.\
🪄✨ task - A chore.\
🪄✨ refactor - Code refactoring.\
🪄✨ polish - Styling and formatting.\
🪄✨ documentation - Changes to the documentation.

#### 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Merging 🏰💯

We use a linear commit history in order to generate the changelogs and release notes and to make it easier to debug.  Use rebase or squash merge in order to keep the history neat.  For almost every use case you should be using rebase instead of squashing in order to preserve the commit history and to properly reflect changes in the generated changelog.  However there are some exceptions to that rule:
🪄✨ Only use rebase if the commits on your local branch have never been pushed to remote.  If you pushed those commits to remote, rebasing it can be a potentially destructive action and then you should squash it instead.\
🪄✨ Each commit should be a meaningful change, if you've made commits with silly messages like "fix: typo" then you should squash it.  Don't include meaningless commits in the history.
