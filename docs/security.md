# 🧚🏻‍♀️✨ Security ✨🧚🏻‍♀️🦄🔮🏰💕

We try to keep our systems secure and to protect our users, but software is volatile and 💩 happens.  If you discover a security vulnerability notify us immediately so we can take care of it.

If you found an issue related to security then don't create a public issue for it, doing so could potentially put users at risk and hurt people, directly [contact](https://github.com/miamatriarx/.github/blob/main/docs/support.md) us instead with as much information as you can about the issue.
